A test implementation of a switch network. Nothing productive.

The Graph is implemented in the form of a adjacency list. And Trees are built taking any arbitrary switch as root.
Routes can be calculated from one switch to another in any particular tree using Lowest Common Ancestor.

The commented code actually belongs to a different problem statement which I didnt want to clear off.
